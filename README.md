60 participants performed up to four 10-minute runs of an annotated rest task as part of a two-session fMRI study that also collected movie-watching, continuous performance task, and post-scan memory and narrative engagement data. Each run of the annotated rest task had 8 trials. In each trial, participants rested for 30 seconds, verbally reported their ongoing thoughts during the preceding resting period for 10 seconds, and rated them on 9 dimensions on a 9-point scale. 

* The functional and structural MRI data will be publicly available on OpenNeuro when the paper gets published. Link: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds006515
* The associated behavioral data are available here: https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/tree/main/data/beh
* The transcriptions of each individualâ€™s spontaneous speech and its USE-semantic embeddings will not be open sourced due to privacy concerns.
* Preprocessed fMRI and eyetracking data are available upon reasonable request.

**Code**

We provide a step-by-step, very detailed instructions to run the scripts that replicate the key findings of this paper (i.e., brain decoding of ongoing thoughts): 
[Code Guide](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/blob/main/Code%20guide_JK.pdf)

The instructions cover code of these following steps:
* **Step00**: preprocess the fMRI data downloaded from OpenNeuro [./code/a_preprocessing](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/tree/main/code/a_preprocessing)
* Step01: load the preprocessed fMRI data [step01_load_netts.m]()
* Step02: calculate FC patterns for each trial [step02_calc_FC.ipynb]
* Step03: representational similarity analysis [step03_FC-thoughts_RSA.ipynb]
* Step04: connectome-based modeling to predict thought dimensions
