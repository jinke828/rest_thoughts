**The Chicago Attentin ang Thoughts (CAT) Dataset**

60 participants performed up to four 10-minute runs of an annotated rest task as part of a two-session fMRI study that also collected movie-watching, continuous performance task, and post-scan memory and narrative engagement data. Each run of the annotated rest task had 8 trials. In each trial, participants rested for 30 seconds, verbally reported their ongoing thoughts during the preceding resting period for 10 seconds, and rated them on 9 dimensions on a 9-point scale. 

* The functional and structural MRI data will be publicly available on OpenNeuro when the paper gets published. Link: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds006515
* The associated behavioral data are available here: https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/tree/main/data/beh
* The transcriptions of each individualâ€™s spontaneous speech and its USE-semantic embeddings will not be open sourced due to privacy concerns.
* Preprocessed fMRI and eyetracking data are available upon reasonable request.

**Code**

We provide a step-by-step, very detailed instructions to run the scripts that replicate the key findings of this paper (i.e., brain decoding of ongoing thoughts): 
[Code Guide](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/blob/main/Code%20guide_JK.pdf)

The instructions cover code of these following steps:
* Step00: preprocess the fMRI data downloaded from OpenNeuro [./code/a_preprocessing](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/tree/main/code/a_preprocessing)

Code for data analysis after preprocessing can be found here: [./code/b_analysis](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/tree/main/code/b_analysis)
* Step01: load the preprocessed fMRI data. [step01_load_netts.m](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/blob/main/code/b_analysis/step01_load_netts.m)
* Step02: calculate FC patterns for each trial. [step02_calc_FC.ipynb](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/blob/main/code/b_analysis/step02_calc_FC.ipynb)
* Step03: representational similarity analysis. [step03_FC-thoughts_RSA.ipynb](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/blob/main/code/b_analysis/step03_FC-thoughts_RSA.ipynb)
* Step04
  - a: connectome-based modeling to predict thought dimensions. [step04a_SVR_dimensions.ipynb](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/blob/main/code/b_analysis/step04a_SVR_dimensions.ipynb)
  - b: plot results from step04a. [step04b_plot_SVR.R](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/blob/main/code/b_analysis/step04b_plot_SVR.R)
  - c: predict imagery in the aphantasic twin. [step04c_predict_aphantasia.ipynb](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/blob/main/code/b_analysis/step04c_predict_aphantasia.ipynb)
* step05: connectome-based modeling to classify thought topics. [step05_SVC_topics.ipynb](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/blob/main/code/b_analysis/step05_SVC_topics.ipynb)
* step06: generalizing the thought models to Human Connectome Project (HCP). [step06_crossdataset_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/blob/main/code/b_analysis/step06_crossdataset_prediction.ipynb)
* step07
  - a: relating predicted thoughts with behavioral measures suing CCA. [step07a_CCA_PC.m](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/blob/main/code/b_analysis/step07a_CCA_PC.m)
  - b: train null thoughts models. [step07b_CCA_null-models](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/tree/main/code/b_analysis/step07b_CCA_null-models)
  - c: compare findings between Ke and Smith. [step07c_compare_Ke-Smith.R](https://github.com/jinke828/rest_thoughts/blob/main/code/b_analysis/step07c_compare_Ke-Smith.R)
