60 participants performed up to four 10-minute runs of an annotated rest task as part of a two-session fMRI study that also collected movie-watching, continuous performance task, and post-scan memory and narrative engagement data. Each run of the annotated rest task had 8 trials. In each trial, participants rested for 30 seconds, verbally reported their ongoing thoughts during the preceding resting period for 10 seconds, and rated them on 9 dimensions on a 9-point scale.
